<p></p>
<h3>2. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We use your Information to:</p>

<p>User acquisition. We work with a variety of user acquisition partners to help us report on the success of our marketing campaigns. We may use some of your personal information to participate in Custom Audience and Lookalike Audience programmes, which enable us to display adverts to both existing and prospective supporters when they visit one of our partners’ websites. We may provide an identifier (i.e. your Advertising ID or Facebook ID) to them so they can determine whether you are a registered account holder with them. Our adverts may then appear when you access their websites. See our list of partners.</p>
<p>Advertising partners. We are an ad-supported service. Subject to your settings, we provide certain Information to advertisers who will use them to serve you with ads in our Games, and we measure who sees and clicks on their ads. We also share advertising identifiers, along with the interests or other characteristics of a device or the person using it, to help partners decide whether to serve an ad to that device or to enable them to conduct marketing, brand analysis, personalise advertising, or similar activities. See our list of partners. For more information on how to limit or opt-out from personalized advertisement, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>Payment processors: For Mobile Games and Facebook Games, we use payment processors such as Google (if you run Android on your mobile device), Apple App Store payments (if you run IOS on your mobile device) and Facebook (if you make a payment in a Facebook Game).

<p></p>
<h3>4. WHERE WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Your Information will be processed by our employees and service providers in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and in Switzerland and Israel, which are both countries which the European Commission has decided offer an adequate level of data protection.
